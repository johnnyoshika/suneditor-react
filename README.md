# suneditor-react

Forked from https://github.com/mkhstar/suneditor-react

This is just a temporary repo to get access to SunEditor v2.83.3, which adds support for dashes in custom tags: https://github.com/JiHong88/SunEditor/issues/716

Once the upstream repo updates with these changes, this repo can be deleted.

Feature request: https://github.com/mkhstar/suneditor-react/issues/196
